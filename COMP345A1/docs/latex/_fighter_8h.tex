\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxylink{class_fighter}{Fighter} class extending the \doxylink{class_character}{Character} with specialized combat abilities. 

This file defines the \doxylink{class_fighter}{Fighter} class, which inherits from \doxylink{class_character}{Character} to provide specific implementations for a combat-\/oriented character type in the Basic Fantasy RPG setting. It includes overrides for attribute calculations to reflect the fighter\textquotesingle{}s combat proficiency.
